I have developed this web app using React.js and Firebase. Some key features of the project are listed below.


1) Personal account that allows user to sign in and sign up.
2) Verify using email address in order to avoid fake registration.
3) User can change their username and password regularly as they find appropriate.
4) User can reset password in case of any mishappening.
5) User can personalize their profile picture.
6) Every user can connect to any other user of this application and can start conversation easily.
7) User can share emojies to express their feelings.
8) Users can also share images and voice notes in order to enhance their conversation.
9) There is no expiry of older conversation, but user can delete coversation explicitly.
10) User will get a push notification, notifing new messages and friend requests.


***This app is being updated regularly and new features are added to enhance the exprience of the user.***











# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
